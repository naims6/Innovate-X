Participants will use generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney), or custom algorithms to create a cohesive series of five high-resolution artworks based on a prompt: 'The Future of Water'.\\n\\nCreativity, technical skill in model manipulation, and the ability to produce aesthetically compelling and original results are key. Ethical considerations regarding training data must be addressed.\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Use of a defined generative AI model/tool\\n- Cohesive artistic style across all five pieces\\n- High-resolution final images (min 4000px on one side)\\n- Technical explanation of the prompt and model parameters used\\n\\n**Deliverables:**\\n- Five high-resolution digital art pieces\\n- 'Behind the Scenes' document detailing model, prompts, and training/fine-tuning process\\n- Public gallery link",
    "taskDetails": "Create five artworks on the theme 'The Future of Water'.\\n\\n1. Select a generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney)\\n2. Iterate and refine prompts to achieve a specific style\\n3. Upscale and post-process the final five images\\n4. Write a brief artist statement for the series\\n5. Document the technical process (prompts, seeds, model version)",
