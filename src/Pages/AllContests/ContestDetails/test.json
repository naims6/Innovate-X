    "description": "A hands-on, infrastructure and security operations challenge. Participants must configure, deploy, and tune a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide maximum protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for a simulated, live e-commerce platform. The goal is to minimize false positives while blocking common attacks like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting, proving deep knowledge of attack patterns and WAF rule logic. ",
    "taskDetails": "Deploy and tune a WAF (using a mock environment of AWS WAF or ModSecurity) for a public-facing e-commerce site.\n\n1. **Rule Set:** Implement a rule set that effectively blocks all SQL Injection and XSS attack vectors without breaking the legitimate checkout process.\n2. **False Positive Reduction:** Analyze and document at least 5 common false positives (e.g., legitimate user input blocked) and provide the fine-tuned rule exclusions to solve them.\n3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement a global rate-limiting rule to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.\n4. **Submission:** Provide the WAF configuration file (e.g., ModSecurity rules or JSON template) and a report documenting all implemented rules and testing results.",
